# Interactive Airline Review Dashboard with Tableau

## Project Overview

This project details the development of an interactive airline review dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard facilitates comprehensive analysis of customer feedback, offering valuable insights for airlines to enhance their services.

## Data Acquisition

To acquire the necessary data for this project, several options were explored:

* **Public Datasets:** 
  - [World Airline Awards](https://www.worldairlineawards.com/): Provides user reviews and ratings.
  - [Transportation Data](https://data.transportation.gov/): Offers consumer complaint data.
* **API Integration (Optional):** For a more extensive dataset, integration with APIs from airlines or review platforms could be considered, though this may require programming expertise.

## Data Transformation

Before utilizing the data in Tableau, it underwent crucial cleaning and manipulation tasks, including:

* Addressing missing values.
* Ensuring consistent date and time formatting.
* Deriving new insights through calculated fields, such as sentiment analysis scores.

## Advanced Visualization Techniques

The dashboard employs advanced Tableau features to create an immersive and informative experience, including:

* **Dynamic Parameters:** Enables users to control key metrics displayed on the dashboard, allowing for focused analysis.
* **Set Actions:** Selecting data points on one visualization triggers dynamic updates across others, revealing connections within the data.
* **LOD Calculations:** Aggregates data at various levels for granular insights into airline performance.
* **Conditional Formatting:** Highlights positive and negative trends in review scores to direct attention to areas needing improvement.
* **Customizable Tooltips:** Provides detailed information, including sentiment analysis scores, reviewer demographics, and specific feedback excerpts.

## Dashboard Interactivity

The dashboard integrates interactive elements to empower user exploration, such as:

* **Filters:** Users can filter data based on specific airlines, routes, date ranges, rating categories, or other criteria.
* **Highlighters:** Selecting data points across multiple visualizations enables synchronized analysis.
* **Drill-Down Capabilities:** Users can explore details behind aggregated data points, such as individual reviews.

## Deliverables

* **Final Tableau Workbook:** Contains the complete interactive dashboard with all visualizations and functionalities.
* **Project Documentation:** Offers a comprehensive overview of project goals, data acquisition methods, and technical aspects of visualization creation.

## Future Enhancements

* Integrate real-time airline data feeds for up-to-date insights.
* Develop machine learning models to predict customer sentiment or identify emerging trends.
* Implement natural language processing (NLP) to analyze textual content of reviews for deeper understanding.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the effectiveness of advanced Tableau techniques in creating an interactive dashboard for airline review analysis. By leveraging these features, airlines can gain valuable insights to enhance their services and improve passenger satisfaction. Furthermore, this project lays the groundwork for further exploration of advanced data visualization techniques and data science applications within the airline industry.
